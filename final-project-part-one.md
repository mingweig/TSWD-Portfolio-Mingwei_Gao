# Outline
 
**Title**: "Unveiling Health Disparities: A Data-Driven Insight into the U.S. Healthcare System"

**Summary**:
The United States, despite its advanced medical technologies and substantial healthcare spending, exhibits a significant disparity in health outcomes and access to medical care[1]. In 2022, the U.S. allocated nearly 16% of its GDP to healthcare, surpassing other OECD countries like Germany, France, and Japan, which had considerably lower percentages[2]. However, this substantial expenditure does not correlate with better health outcomes. In contrast, the life expectancy in the U.S. lags behind other developed nations[3]. 

This project aims to delve into the nuances of this disparity by examining various data sets, including health expenditure as a percentage of GDP, life expectancy, trends in health insurance coverage, and the impact of these factors on different ethnic groups. Through this analysis, the project seeks to uncover the underlying causes of the healthcare disparity in the U.S., focusing on how economic, racial, and social factors intertwine to shape the health landscape of the nation. The goal is to inform, engage, and provoke thoughtful discussions on the need for equitable healthcare reforms.

# The data

The data for this project is sourced from diverse reputable and authoritative institutions, ensuring reliability and accuracy. The core data on health expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) for selected countries in 2022 and Life expectancy in G7 countries comes from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This data is pivotal in establishing a comparative framework for analyzing healthcare spending across different nations. 

For insights into U.S. national health expenditure trends from 1960 to 2021, we rely on data provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which offers a comprehensive view of historical spending patterns. The statistics regarding the percentage of people without health insurance in the United States, segregated by ethnicity from 2010 to 2022, and life expectancy in the U.S. by race, are sourced from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), providing a lens into insurance coverage disparities. Additionally, data on the distribution of health professionals in the U.S. by race and ethnicity for 2019 is extracted from an investigation from (Journal of the American Medical Association)JAMA, complementing our analysis with workforce diversity aspects. Finally, data on and the experiences of immigrant adults with healthcare providers, are derived from Kaiser Family Foundation(KFF). 

The use of these data is planned to construct a coherent narrative around healthcare disparities in the U.S. The project begins by introducing the U.S.'s healthcare expenditure against that of other developed countries, using the OECD data to highlight the anomaly of high spending versus relatively lower health outcomes. The time-based data on U.S. health expenditure from CMS will be used to trace the healthcare investment over time, seeking correlations with changes in life expectancy. The Census Bureau's data on uninsured populations will enable an analysis of healthcare access disparities across different ethnic groups, while the data on healthcare professionals' demographics will highlight workforce diversity to patient demographics. 

The life expectancy data from the CDC will be important in highlighting the differences in health outcomes based on race and ethnicity, underscoring the systemic nature of these disparities. The KFF data on immigrant healthcare experiences will add to explore how treatment within the healthcare system varies among different groups. Each dataset will be utilized to support specific aspects of the narrative, with visualizations to bring informative aspects of the data, aiming to foster a deeper understanding of the complicated nature of healthcare disparities in the United States.

# Method and medium

For my final project, I hope to use Tableau to create dynamic, interactive visualizations. Tableau's strength in bringing data to life will be key in illustrating the healthcare disparities in the U.S. These visualizations will then be integrated into Story Maps, providing a narrative flow alongside the data. This combination will allow me to construct a story that's informative and immersive, offering a better experience than traditional PowerPoint slides. My aim is to deliver a unique, interactive digital story that effectively communicates the data.
