# User research 

## Target audience

The target audience of this story includes healthcare policymakers, medical professionals, public policy students, public health students, and even all the interested general public. I aim to reach those who are already in the healthcare industry or students who have the potential to influence or advocate for healthcare reform in the future at Heinz College.

## Interview script

There are 4 main goals of the interview,

1. Check whether audiences get the idea of the story.

2. Understand the audience's awareness of healthcare disparities.

3. Evaluate the emotional impact of the visualizations.

4. Collect actionable feedback to improve the narrative.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |

|Topic Identification| What do you think this story is talking about? |
|Awareness| How familiar are you with the disparities in the U.S. healthcare system? |
|Eemotional Impact| Which part of the Story (Visualization / Text) had the most emotional impact on you?|

| Questions               | Interview 1 (Public Policy Student) | Interview 2 (Medical Doctor Student) | Interview 3 (Healthcare Analytic Student) |
|-------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
|What do you think this story is talking about? |It feels like the main topic is the unequal distribution of healthcare resources among different races, with people of color facing unfair treatment in healthcare. |he primary focus of this story seems to be the inequality within the U.S. healthcare system. It's a critical issue that affects many lives.|The inequity and accessibility problems in the U.S. Healthcare System among different ethnic groups in terms of healthcare resources.|
|How familiar are you with the disparities in the U.S. healthcare system? |As an international student, I'm not very familiar with this, but it's indeed difficult to find Chinese doctors during medical visits.|I am aware there's inequity in healthcare, but I'm not fully versed in the extent or depth of the real situation. I know it's significant.|I'm quite familiar with these disparities. I've observed many patients, especially minorities, struggle with health literacy, which affects their ability to access healthcare.|
|Which part of the Story (Visualization / Text) had the most emotional impact on you? |I think the most impactful was the chart comparing the proportion of doctors to the racial population. It reminds me of the difficulties in finding Chinese doctors and the language barriers during consultations, which can be a significant obstacle, especially for older migrants who can't describe their symptoms due to language issues.|What really struck me was the declining trend in the U.S. healthcare system's effectiveness. It's concerning to see such patterns in a developed country.|It's striking that the U.S. spends a lot on healthcare, yet the life expectancy of its general population is the lowest among the compared countries.|
|What changes would make the data more compelling or clearer? |There seems to be a disconnect between the first and second halves. Are you trying to say that despite the high spending in the U.S., life expectancy has declined due to uneven distribution? Need More action advice.|Regarding the 'The Disparity' slide, I suggest sorting the bars to make the data more digestible and the disparities more evident. This could help in better understanding the scale of the issue.|The storyline in that slide isn't very consistent. The conclusion could offer some constructive suggestions.|
