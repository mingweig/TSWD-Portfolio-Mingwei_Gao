# Changes made since Part II

**Enhanced Visualizations**: Adopted a consistent color palette and switched to rectangular bar charts for all data visualizations, ensuring design consistency as comments from part II.

**Narrative Integration**: Inserted additional text sections/visualizations to create a completed story structure, addressing previously identified gaps between sections for a coherent storyline.

**Targeted Calls to Action**: Add the calls to action to be more specific for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and the general public, ensuring each has clear, actionable steps.

**Focused Audience Narrative**: Narrowed the story's scope to more effectively address the nuances of the healthcare experience by different races, based on user feedback for a more targeted approach.

**Shorthand Transition**: Initiated the move to the Shorthand platform, used its features for a more polished and engaging presentation, in line with the latest feedback.

**Data Visualization Standardization**: Working towards creating and using visualizations that are consistent with the visual language of the entire story.

## The audience

The audience for my final data story is primarily **policymakers and healthcare professionals**, with a secondary audience of the **informed general public**, particularly those interested in public health and social equity. Insights from interviews and feedback, especially with healthcare students and professionals, highlighted the need for a narrative that not only presents data but also educates and prompts action. 

To address these audiences, the project was refined to include more actionable insights and clearer calls to action. The visualizations and text were tailored to engage a policy-oriented mindset, with emphasis on the implications of the data on policy and practice.

## Final design decisions

In refining the design for the final project, my designs were centered around enhancing user engagement and clarity. I chose a color palette that resonates with both policymakers and healthcare professionals, at the same time, ensuring it's accessible to the general public as well. Interactive elements were added to encourage active participation. Throughout the process, I learned the importance of design consistency in storytelling and the impact of visual simplicity in conveying complex data. These adjustments were influenced by feedback from interviews and aimed to create a narrative that is both informative and actionable
