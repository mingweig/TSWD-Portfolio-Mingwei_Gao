## About Me

Hi there! My name is Mingwei Gao. I'm a student at Carnegie Mellon University, where I'm pursuing my Master's degree. I'm passionate about the intersection of data science and visual storytelling, which is why I enrolled in this course while taking courses like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Question Answering.

## What I Hope to Learn

From this course, I aspire to:
1. Grasp the art and science behind effective data visualization.
2. Understand the nuances of different visualization tools and techniques.
3. Develop the capability to tell compelling stories backed by data.
4. Engage with peers to gain diverse perspectives on visual storytelling.

## My Work
Throughout this course, I'll be undertaking various projects and assignments that reflect my understanding and application of the principles taught. Below are some highlights:

- **Web page URL**: [TSWD Portfolio Main Page](https://mingweig.github.io/TSWD-Portfolio-Mingwei_Gao/)


Stay tuned for more updates on my projects!

- **Assignment**: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt.md)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

- **Assignment 3&4**: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design.md)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

**Final project**
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project.

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)


### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
