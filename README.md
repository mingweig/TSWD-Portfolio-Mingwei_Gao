## About Me

Hi there! My name is Mingwei Gao. I'm a student at Carnegie Mellon University, where I'm pursuing my Master's degree. I'm passionate about the intersection of data science and visual storytelling, which is why I enrolled in this course while taking courses like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Question Answering.

## What I Hope to Learn

From this course, I aspire to:
1. Grasp the art and science behind effective data visualization.
2. Understand the nuances of different visualization tools and techniques.
3. Develop the capability to tell compelling stories backed by data.
4. Engage with peers to gain diverse perspectives on visual storytelling.

## My Work
Throughout this course, I'll be undertaking various projects and assignments that reflect my understanding and application of the principles taught. Below are some highlights:
